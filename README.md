Please use the following modules to correctly run the code provided in the notebook:

numpy

Included at the top of the Jupyter Notebook are the required modules already included:

Please note that the need to import the csv and numpy array files into the colab environment is unnecessary due to the inclusion of this line near the top of the notebook:
